Castaways - A version of Spaceships SEI
In this project One, we will be building Castaways, a game where a secret word is generated, once generated a coresponding amount of blank spaces to represent the letters in said word. The player then gets to make their play by choosing one letter out of the alphabet. If the letter is correct, it is then displayed in the placeholder word in it's respective spot. If the guess is incorrect, the player then loses a turn and the player loses an "item" and a point. The game is over either once the player guesses the word and still has points/items left, or the player has 0 items/points left and the word has not been correctly guessed. 

For the game, the story is, The player was on a plane that crashed, once they woke up they were stranded on an island with survival items, a boat, and a monster. The monster wants to eat the player, but wants to play a game first. So the monster challenges the player to play castaways, if the player can guess the word via the rules in above paragraph, the player will win, and the moster will let the player get into the boat and sail away. If the player runs out of guesses before guessing the word, then the player will lose and has to stay on the island. The player should have the option to challenge the moster to another game where a game will be restarted, or to exit the game. 

There should be 3 levels of difficulty - the difficulty is the amount of incorrect guesses the user will get. Easy = 10 wrong guesses - 10 points/items
medium = 8 wrong guesses - 8 points/items
hard = 6 wrong guesses - 6 points/items
If the user can guess the word prior to losing all their points then they will be awarded with another life. And the chance to play another game, or escape the island and exit the game.

You completed the hardest part! Great job, now the fun stuff, the toppings as they say. You are doing a great job! You are awesome! You got this!
Once the funtionality of the game has been completed, look at the color scheme, are you going to depressed manic work to get out of the situations or are you going for a juxtapostion of cheerful light summer island colors? Deep and dark or light and cheery?
//Add some audio! For each incorrect guess, make a BUZZ, correct, add a ding!
Add a link embedded to the words definition
Hints! Everyone loves a good hint now and again, add an optional hint button. (they only get one per game! *maybe 2 if you're feeling generous)
