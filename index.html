            <p>Welcome Player, to the Island of Castaways. As you were flying your Plane over the seas, you were caught in a hurricane and crashed down on this mystical place. We need your help. The island has been overtaken by the wicked Wasteful Monsters, they keep dumping their horrible pollution into our waters, they are killing our sea. The only way they will stop is by beating them in a game of words. If you win, you will stop that Monster from dumping their waste. If you lose, our earth suffers.</p>
            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Monster will choose a Secret Word</li>
                <li>For each Letter in that Word, a placeholder will be displayed</li>
                <li>You then will guess a letter,</li>
                <li>If your guessed letter is in the Monster's word, the letter will be displayed</li>
                <li>Guess incorrectly and you lose a life point,</li>
                <li>When your Life Points are at 0, you have Lost the Game.</li>
                <li>Guess the full word with life points to spare and you have Won the Game and have Stopped the Monster!</li>
